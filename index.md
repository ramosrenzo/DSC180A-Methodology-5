Applying Transformer Models to Microbiome Data to Improve Human and Environmental Health

Instructor: Rob Knight

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the use of Genomic Pre-Train 
Networks (GPN) and how it compares to traditional predictors in the biology domain.  Learning about 
pretraining a language model based on a convolutional neural network (cnn) was also very interesting.  
I wasn't very familiar with how machine learning or language models were used in biology, so I was intrigued
to have a better understanding.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project would be identifying patterns in either 
the skin or gut microbiome in order to predict whether a person is at risk of any diseases.  It would also be 
interesting to see if analyzing gut microbiome data could tell us about a person's diet habits.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is to have everyone's roles 
and tasks be clear.  I'd also like to have more specificity when it comes to weekly progress.  It would be a lot 
easier if we know exactly what we're having trouble with at the beginning of the week so there can be discussion, 
and what we plan to accomplish by the end of the week so that we can make satisfactory progress.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Other techniques that I'd be interested in using in my project is possibly image or visual AI tools.  It would be 
interesting to somehow incorporate computer vision to analyze skin-related diseases and how they link to the skin 
microbiome.
